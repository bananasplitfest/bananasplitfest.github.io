Did your momma ever say you couldn't have ice cream because your room wasn't clean? Well we want to make sure we can have ice cream for the celebration, so we're doing our part to clean up the town.

We're partnering with the City of Latrobe and The Latrobe Community Revitalization Program to get a few things knocked off momma's to-do list before the event. Bring a pair of gloves and some work clothes to help out. It'll be fun and afterwards there is sure to be a group going to the downtown Valley Dairy location for some ice cream!
