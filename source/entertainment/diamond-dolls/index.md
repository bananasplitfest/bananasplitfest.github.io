The Diamond Dolls Twirling Team, based in Derry, is in their 18th year, established in 1999.  The team is open to girls, ages 4-17 years old, from any school district, with or without baton twirling experience.  Parade/Performance teams only, as well as Competitive teams, and private lessons are offered. Classes are assigned based on age and skill level, including Beginner through Competitive.  (Competitive and Mini-Competitive team are by evaluation only).  The Diamond Dolls practice on Tuesday or Thursday evenings (dependent on class assignment), from January through August, at the Grandview Elementary School. (Competitive team practices are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.)  They march in local parades and entertain at church and community festivals throughout the summer months.  They are a familiar site at the Derry Memorial Day and Railroad Days, Blairsville Knotweed, and Latrobe Fourth of July & Christmas parades.

The Competitive & Mini-Competitive teams (part of the larger 55 member team) are the 2016 International Junior Strut Team Champions, 2016 International Junior Novelty Team Champions, and the 2016 International Tiny Tot Novelty Team Champions. Over the years, Diamond Dolls has won 24 Twirling Unlimited International Championships and 26 Twirling Unlimited Regional championships!
