“Big Jam” is how Morning Glass Entertainment describes the genre of Derek Woods Band. “Big” probably comes from the 5-piece lineup that makes up DWB, including 11 different instruments and the lead vocals of Derek Woods as well as up to four of the members providing backup harmonies. “Jam” most likely comes from DWB’s tendency to transition in the midst of their lyric-driven rock n’roll style original songs into a seemingly free-for-all jam pulled together by solos and danceable beats that allow you to lose yourself to the music of the moment.

Woods is the Pittsburgh-born son of Tim Woods, a 2012 inductee into the Blues Hall of Fame. 

Derek Woods BAND formed in 2011 in Los Angeles, California. The band includes an instrumental lineup of acoustic guitar, harmonica, lead electric guitar, mandolin (acoustic and electric), keys, drums, percussion/congas, kaossilator, and bass. In February 2013, DWB recorded seven tracks at 20 Cedar Studios in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The album, “Dancin’”, was released worldwide on August 31, 2013. DWB has shared the stage with many well-known musicians including The Werks, Anders Osborne, Rusted Root, Tim Reynolds (Dave Matthews Band), Leon Russell, Lisa Marie Presley and Lukas Nelson (Willie Nelson’s son).

DWB has toured along the East and West coast and in many different fashions including Derek Woods solo, acoustic duo and trio performances and, more prominently, the well-known, full band, five-piece suit.

DWB defines themselves as being reminiscent of an energetic 60’s-70’s Rock n’ Roll vibe while incorporating a new-age jam-style atmosphere.
