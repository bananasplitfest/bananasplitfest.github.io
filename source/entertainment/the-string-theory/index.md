The String Theory is an energetic, acoustic alternative band based out of Greensburg, PA that plays an array of covers and multiple genres. Sound includes anywhere from relaxed to upbeat, also adding the uniqueness of the violin and ukelele to many recognizable songs you know and love. 
Powerful vocals, tight harmonies, catchy rhythms and soothing violin accompaniment, with some occasional fiddling for all to enjoy! Put together by band members, Tim Camarote (Lead Vocalist, Guitarist) and Brendan Kuntz (Violinist, Ukelele, Vocals, Percussion).
