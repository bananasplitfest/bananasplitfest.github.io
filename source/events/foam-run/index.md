### Foamtastic!
This run isn’t about keeping track of your time. It’s all about having a blast with family and friends as you complete the course running (or walking) through fountains of colorful foam!

Participants will receive a white shirt (for added color later!), wrist bracelet, and bib. 

At 12pm noon, the foam starts to flow! Runners and walkers will traverse an (almost) 5k course that is packed with 7 foam stations, water features, TONS of color, and more!!

The race ends with DJ Dark Shark's foam dance party at the finish line.
