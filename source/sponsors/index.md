Greetings!

The GLLV Chamber of Commerce could not be more proud of the success and rapid growth of the Great American Banana Split Celebration. In 2016 the event brought over 25,000 people to downtown Latrobe from 6 states and over 10 counties in PA. We expect crowds this year to exceed 35,000.

Our volunteer executive committee has already started planning the 2017 celebration, and we are excited about all the additions to this year’s event. An event the size of the Great American Banana Split Celebration would not be possible without the support of our sponsors and business partners. If you supported last year’s event, thank you!

2017 will bring a continued emphasis on the banana split theme, and we are looking forward to meeting new vendors, upgrading activities, and enhancing all entertainment. Our executive committee has put together big goals for 2017, and we hope that you will continue growing with us as the Great American Banana Split Celebration becomes a must attend event in Western Pennsylvania!

Returning this year will be the 5K Banana Run, Yellow Tie Gala, Climbing Wall, and Activity Arena. New additions will include a second entertainment stage filled with local music and talent, an enlarged vendor area with all new craft and food vendors, and an upgrade to the fun Color Dash run. The Great American Banana Split Celebration is fun for kids, adults, and families. Keep an eye out for more details!

Attached is this year’s sponsorship form, exhibitor guidelines, and application. We hope that you will join us as we celebrate all that our communities have to offer! If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out directly by phone (724-537-2671 ext.103) or email (info@bananasplitfest.com). See you in August!


Cheers,
Allen J. Martello, Interim President
